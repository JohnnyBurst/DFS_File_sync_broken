1. You have validated offline files and folders is broken - files are not syncing properly

2. You have either made a backup of user data on the root of C:\ or verified all data is on the destination server
- If you are not sure what all is in the offline cache, then look by viewing the offline files using sync center

If you delete the CSC folder without backing up the users documents, desktop, and favorites to the local C drive or backing up the whole CSC folder you could lose data that hadn't been synced to the server.

3. Disable Offline Files and Folders
- Open the Start menu > type Regedit > on Registry Editor shift + right-click > run as different user > use ADM account
- File > import > browse to Disable_Offline_Files.reg

4. Reboot the system

5. Have the user login > run CMD as ADM and run command to take ownership and delete the CSC folder and subfolders/files
- Run takeown /r /f c:\windows\csc - Y for yes to write permissions
- Then rd /s c:\windows\csc - Y to confirm delete

6. Enable Offline Files and Folders

- Open Start > type Regedit > on Registry Editor shift + right-click > run as different user > use ADM account
- File > import > browse to Enable_Offline_Files.reg

7. Reboot the system

8. Login as the user

10. Perform a gpupdate /force > type Y for yes to logout of the system

11. Have the user login and verify they can do what they need with their data by syncing a test file or two - depending on how much data the user has will determine the amount of time needed to fully re-sync the data from the server - if you see a grey x on files the data is still syncing with offline files and folders
